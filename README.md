# MyReads Project

This is the working application of the MyReads project in the Udacity React Nanodegree course.

# Installation

# How it works

By clicking on the + button you search for books in the database. Please be aware that only search terms from the SEARCH_TERMS.md file are valid.

You can organize your books on three shelves: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read". Just click on the green button on each book to move it between shelves.

Happy reading! :-)
